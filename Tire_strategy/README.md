## Introduction

In Formula 1 racing, tire strategy is critical for success. We are refining a  model to assess its impact on race results. The model analyzes factors like compound choice and stint lengths, using historical data and algorithms to link tire strategy with performance. Our goal is to equip strategists with insights for data-informed decisions that can lead to victory.
