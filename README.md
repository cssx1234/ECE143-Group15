## Introduction

In Formula 1 racing, the delicate interplay between various factors can significantly influence driver performance. This data analysis project delves into the nuanced relationships that exist between age and experience, tire strategy, home advantage, gear downshifts, and weather conditions concerning driver performance. By scrutinizing these elements, we aim to unravel the intricate tapestry of influences that shape the outcome of races. Whether it's the seasoned expertise of a veteran driver, the strategic decisions made regarding tire usage, the impact of racing on home turf, the artful execution of gear downshifts, or the unpredictable dance with weather conditions, each aspect contributes to the dynamic mosaic that defines success in the high-stakes world of motorsports. Through comprehensive analysis, this project seeks to provide valuable insights into the multifaceted nature of driver performance, contributing to a deeper understanding of the sport's dynamics and potentially informing strategies for both drivers and teams alike.

## Scripts

In the "data gathering script" folder, find the 'f1_weather_data_analysis.py' script for data collection. After running the script, it should produce five csv files used for data analysis. The "plots scripts" folder contains scripts to generate correlation and histogram plots either  individually, or all together using "plots.py". Python 3.9.13 was used in making these scripts.
