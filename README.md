In the "data gathering script" folder, find the 'f1_weather_data_analysis.py' script for data collection. After running the script, it should produce five csv files used for data analysis. The "plots scripts" folder contains scripts to generate correlation and histogram plots either  individually, or all together using "plots.py". Python 3.9.13 was used in making these scripts.
